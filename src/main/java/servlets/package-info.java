/**
 * Provides servlets for the Rail Fence Cipher application.
 *
 * This package encompasses servlets responsible for managing user interactions in the application.
 * It includes servlets dedicated to handling encryption and decryption requests,
 * displaying the history of operations, and managing session and cookie data.
 *
 * Each servlet performs specific tasks such as receiving user inputs, invoking the model
 * for necessary operations (like encryption, decryption, and retrieving operation history),
 * and directing the user to appropriate views (JSP pages) based on the results.
 *
 * The servlets in this package represent the controller component of the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
 * architecture, orchestrating the application's logic, user interaction, and integration
 * with the model layer. Special attention is given to handling exceptions, validating user inputs,
 * and maintaining the session and cookie integrity.
